  abstract      = { In this AFP entry, we formalize the core of the Safely Composable Document Object Model (SC DOM).
                  The SC DOM improve the standard DOM by strengthening the tree boundaries set by shadow roots: in the
                  SC DOM, the shadow root is a sub-class of the document class (instead of a base class).

                  This modifications also results in changes to some API methods (e.g., getOwnerDocument) to return the
                  nearest shadow root rather than the document root. As a result, many API methods that, when called on
                  a node inside a shadow tree, would previously ``break out'' and return or modify nodes that are
                  possibly outside the shadow tree, now stay within its boundaries. This change in behavior makes
                  programs that operate on shadow trees more predictable for the developer and allows them to make more
                  assumptions about other code accessing the DOM. },

	abstract = {At its core, the Document Object Model (DOM) defines a tree-like           
                    data structure for representing documents in general and HTML  
                    documents in particular. It forms the heart of any rendering engine 
                    of modern web browsers. Formalizing the key concepts of the DOM is 
                    a pre-requisite for the formal reasoning over client-side JavaScript 
                    programs as well as for the analysis of security concepts in modern 
                    web browsers. In this paper, we present a formalization of the core DOM, 
                    with focus on the node-tree and the operations defined on node-trees, 
                    in Isabelle/HOL. We use the formalization to verify the functional 
                    correctness of the most important functions defined in the DOM standard. 
                    Moreover, our formalization is (1) extensible, i.e., can be extended without 
                    the need of re-proving already proven properties and (2) executable, i.e., 
                    we can generate executable code from our specification.},
